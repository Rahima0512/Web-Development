# Web-Development
revision modules from scratch of the course covered by me

At 55+ hours, this Web Development course is without a doubt the most comprehensive web development course available online. Even if you have zero programming experience, this course will take you from beginner to mastery. Here's why:

The course is taught by the lead instructor at the App Brewery, London's leading in-person programming bootcamp.

The course has been updated to be 2022 ready and you'll be learning the latest tools and technologies used at large companies such as Apple, Google and Netflix.

This course doesn't cut any corners, there are beautiful animated explanation videos and tens of real-world projects which you will get to build.

The curriculum was developed over a period of four years, with comprehensive student testing and feedback.

We've taught over a million students how to code and many have gone on to change their lives by becoming professional developers or starting their own tech startup.

You'll save yourself over $12,000 by enrolling, but still get access to the same teaching materials and learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.

The course is constantly updated with new content, with new projects and modules determined by students - that's you!
